      <p>I was born in the year when the Live Aid concerts took place, Microsoft's Windows 1.0 was released and Super Mario Bros. on the NES was available in shops.</p>
      <p> Yes, it was indeed 1985.</p>
      <p>I chose these three events from my birth year for a reason. The reason being that, apart from growing up using Windows, I also love retro video games and music. Music is something I simply can't
        go without. I could talk for days about The Beatles' albums or John Mayer's guitar playing, but that's not what this section was intended for.</p>
        <p>So, I'm a somewhat 'seasoned' computer and Internet user. I've experienced the web since the time of dial-up modems. I was 13 years old when I built my <em>very own</em> HTML-only website about myself, complete with animated GIFs and marquee texts, hosted at Angelfire.com (remember those guys?).</p>
